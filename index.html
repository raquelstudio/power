          contemporary lives. From the birth of the Internet as Cyberspace, under the yoke of Silicon Valley elites, to mineral mining industries, all of these are cogs that make
          those <span class="theme-intro">SYSTEMS OF *POWER*</span> work.</p>
        <p>The Systems of Power are served by technological tools that arose from the computer revolution. Tools are simply tools, able to be used for many different kinds of
          purposes. In common, as most tools do, they have the capacity to imbue a user with power. Either as tools of oppression or liberation, they’re both

                  fiction as both an origin of and end to the Internet,” (...) which stemmed from cyberspace’s seductive Orientalist “orientation” and navigability. For all of <em>Neuromancer</em>’s
                  grimness, it portrayed cyberspace as an addictive consensual hallucination dominated by American outlaw console cowboys, who overcame Japanese control by transcending
                  the physical limitations of their bodies and their circumstances. Cyberspace was the Wild West meets speed meets Yellow Peril meets capitalism on steroids.

                escaping, or resenting its imprisonment. The term has two uses. The first and most frequent refers to a computer system’s (figurative) act of acquiring certain data as input,
                whether from a human operator or from an electronic or electromechanical device. (…) “capture,” which is more common in artificial intelligence research, refers to a representation
                scheme’s ability to fully, accurately, or “cleanly” express particular semantic notions or distinctions, without reference to the actual taking-in of data. (…) The capture model

                      <br>(1) linguistic metaphors for human activities, assimilating them to the constructs of a computer system’s representation languages;
                      <br>(2) the assumption that the linguistic “parsing” of human activities involves active intervention in and reorganization of those activities;
                      <br>(3) structural metaphors; the captured activity is figuratively assembled from a “catalog” of parts provided as part of its institutional setting;
                      <br>(4) decentralized and heterogeneous organization; the process is normally conducted within particular, local practices which involve people in the workings of larger social formations; and
                      <br>(5) the driving aims are not political but philosophical, as activity is reconstructed through assimilation to a transcendent (“virtual”) order of mathematical formalism.</p>
                <p>(…) the capture model is a philosophical metaphor in the same sense as the surveillance model is a political metaphor. (…) The two sets of metaphors have significantly
                different origins. Whereas the surveillance model originates in the classically political sphere of state action, the capture model has deep roots in the practical application

                <p>These <em>grammars of action</em> are central to the capture model. (…) The capture model describes the situation that results when grammars of action are imposed upon human activities,
                and when the newly reorganized activities are represented by computers in real time. (…)</p>
                <p>(…) the phenomenon of capture is deeply ingrained in the practice of computer system design through a metaphor of human activity as a kind of language. Within this practice,
